/**
 * The <tt>AclEntry</tt> domain class contains entries representing grants
 * (or denials) of a permission on an object instance to a recipient.
 * The aclObject field references the domain class instance (since an instance
 * can have many granted permissions). The aclSid field references the recipient.
 * The granting field determines whether the entry grants the permission (true)
 * or denies it (false). The aceOrder field specifies the position of the entry,
 * which is important because the entries are evaluated in order and the first
 * matching entry determines whether access is allowed. The mask field holds the
 * permission. auditSuccess and auditFailure determine whether to log success
 * and/or failure events (these both default to true).
