/**
 * A two- or three-dimensional coordinate system that consists of any combination of coordinate axes not covered by any other coordinate system type. An example is a multilinear coordinate system which contains one coordinate axis that may have any 1-D shape which has no intersections with itself. This non-straight axis is supplemented by one or two straight axes to complete a 2 or 3 dimensional coordinate system. The non-straight axis is typically incrementally straight or curved. A UserDefinedCS shall have two or three usesAxis associations.
